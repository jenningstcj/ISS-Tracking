<p>This application serves as a more sophisticated 'Todo' app for learning new languages/frameworks while working on something that is fun and exciting. This simple app explores many of the functions/features that one would encounter in a larger app -- routing, api calls, build processes.  To enable the <span style="font-style:italics">fun</span> part of the application, I am using the <a href="http://open-notify.org/">Open Notify</a> to retrieve information about the International Space Station.  Using the links in the menu bar above, you can see the names of the current astronauts on the station, view the location on Google Maps, and check the next times the station will pass over a city near you.</p>
