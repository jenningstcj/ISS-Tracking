# ISS-Tracking
Simple app written in a few frameworks to act as a fun learning tool while being useful and fun.  Shows current location of the International Space Station, along with current astronauts on board, and next pass times over a city near you.

This application serves as a more sophisticated 'Todo' app for learning new languages/frameworks while working on something that is fun and exciting. To enable the fun part of the application, I am using the [Open Notify API](http://open-notify.org/) to retrieve information about the International Space Station.  You can see the names of the current astronauts on the station, view the location on Google Maps, and check the next times the station will pass over a city near you.

This repo includes the following versions:

[jQuery](https://github.com/jenningstcj/ISS-Tracking/tree/jQueryAjax)

[Angular 1.x](https://github.com/jenningstcj/ISS-Tracking/tree/angularjs)

[Angular 2.0](https://github.com/jenningstcj/ISS-Tracking/tree/angular2)

[Elm](https://github.com/jenningstcj/IntroToElm/tree/master/Demos/GoogleMaps) ([demo](https://jenningstcj.github.io/IntroToElm/Demos/GoogleMaps/index.html))

To view a demo of the Angular 2.0 version, go [here](https://jenningstcj.github.io/ISS-Tracking/dist).  In Google Chrome, you may have to 'allow unsafe scripts' in the address bar since the Open Notify API is non-HTTPS.
